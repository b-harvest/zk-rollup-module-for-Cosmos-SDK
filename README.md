# zk-rollup-module-for-Cosmos-SDK

This repository is for explaining objectives and technical description of how B-Harvest will implement zk-rollup module for Cosmos-SDK

## Short Summary

zk-rollup methodology utilizing zk-SNARKs provide an efficient way to scale out from the Cosmos Hub (the Hub = Layer 1 = L1) to an application specific Cosmos Zone (a Zone = Layer 2 = L2) without sacrificing the security of the Hub.

In order to give the Hub ability to support any governance-allowed Zone with zk-rollup security enhancement, the Hub should adopt a generalized zk-rollup module which will provide zk-proof verification and merkle tree management functionality.

In this project, B-Harvest will provide "full zk-rollup package" to provide the community full development cycle to adopt additional zk-rollup supported Zone.

## Background Technology

There exists multiple toolkits for zk-SNARKs. To name a few, 

- [https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark) : C++
- [https://github.com/zcash/zcash](https://github.com/zcash/zcash) : C++
- [https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/roll_up](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/roll_up) : C++
- [https://github.com/zkcrypto/bellman](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bellman) : rust
- [https://github.com/Zokrates/ZoKrates](https://github.com/Zokrates/ZoKrates) : rust
- [https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync) : rust
- [https://github.com/Loopring/protocols](https://github.com/Loopring/protocols) : C++
- [https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark) : golang

B-Harvest investigated many existing implementations and found out that the "gnark" implemented by Consensys is very concise, no library dependency, language compatible to Cosmos-SDK, performance optimized, and also providing relevant tools for simple usecase of zk-SNARKs and zk-rollup.

Not to re-invent the wheel, we will actively re-utilize many parts of gnark implementation to create entire zk-rollup package customized to Tendermint/Cosmos-SDK based blockchain usecase.

The gnark repository includes 

- Groth16 implentation with
    - prover and verifier programs
    - ellptic curves : Edward twisted BN256, Edward twisted BLS381
    - merkle tree hash : MiMC
- Circuit programming tool
    - conversion system from constraint system (in golang) into R1CS
    - necessary circuit gadgets for elliptic curves and merkle tree hashing
    - pseudo zk-SNARKs setup script to output prover&verifier key

    1) frontend : transaction broadcast

    - user create transaction on frontend
    - the transaction is broadcasted to L2 network

    2) L2 consensus : block commit with the transaction

    - proposer includes the transaction in a block
    - the block with the transaction is committed by L2 consensus
    - suggested merkle tree change is stored

    3) prover : read suggested merkle tree change on L2

    4) prover : calculate zk-proof

    - prover finds new suggested **merkle tree change**
    - **zk-prover** calculate **zk-proof** for the **merkle tree change** using predefined **circuit program**

    5) prover : transaction broadcasting

    - prover broadcasts zk-proof transaction
    - including merkle tree change and its zk-proof

    6) L2 consensus : block commit with the zk-proof

    - proposer includes the zk-proof transaction in a block
    - L2 consensus verifies the consistency of zk-proof
    - the block with the zk-proof transaction is committed by L2 consensus

    7) IBC relayer : relays committed zk-proof from L2 to L1

    8) L1 consensus : verify zk-proof

    - L1 consensus receives zk-proof relayed by IBC relayer
    - L1 consensus verify the received zk-proof

    9) L1 consensus : update merkle tree

    - L1 apply merkle tree change which is verified by zk-proof
    - updated merkle tree is committed on L1

    10) IBC relayer : relays updated merkle tree from L1 to L2

## Rollup Comparison : Optimistic Rollup

**The Advantage of Optimistic Rollup : Flexibility**

- Optimistic rollup can be adopted to any kind of general computation or smart contract
- Current zk-rollup technology does not provide general computation capability
    - Therefore it is only for relatively simple computation logic
    - But the technology is towards more general computation in future
    - Reason of inflexibility of zk-rollup
        - The entire computation logic should be written in circuit program, which is very low-level language without convenient functions
        - However, developers in zk-rollup industry keep supporting various kind of high-level functions from the low-level language

**Security Problems of Optimistic Rollup which can be solved by zk-rollup**

- Fraud proof assumption
    - Why problem?
        - Security depends on the existence of fraud proof activities when attack comes
        - Even with generous incentives, it is very difficult to guarantee this assumption
    - Why does zk-rollup solve it?
        - zk-rollup completely guarantees computation genuinity by very fast verifier algorithm without any need of "fisherman" like activity
        - It allows zk-rollup to possess perfect layer 1 security without any security assumption
- Delayed Finality
    - Why problem?
        - Optimistic rollup requires certain duration of time(usually 1 week) for fraud provers to find any existing fraud activities on the network
        - Even after this period, we cannot say the finality is on "layer-1-level-security", because fraud proof assumption is difficult to be guaranteed
    - Why does zk-rollup solve it?
        - zk-rollup gets its layer 1 finality via mathematical proof rather than incentivized economic activities of fruad proof
        - Any state change is 100% finalized on layer 1 when verified proof is calculated by anyone, and received by layer 1
        - Finalization latency of zk-rollup depends on the calculation time of zk-proof, but such calculation work can be efficiently parallelized, the latency is matter of minutes even in 1k tps situation
        - It can be confidently guaranteed that in near future, with enough computation resource and more efficient parallel computing algorithms, the finality latency of zk-rollup will become several seconds even in 1k tps situation

**Combination of Different Rollup Approach**

- Usecases of Optimistic Rollup
    - more generalized computation
    - less security necessity
    - less demands on fast finality
- Usecases of zk-rollup
    - more specific and concise computation
    - perfect layer-1 security necessity : Defi, deposit significant assets to layer 2
    - high demands on fast finality : Interchain utilities, trading, payment

## User Benefit / Ecosystem Impact

**Efficient and Secure Scalability Solution for Cosmos Ecosystem**

- zk-rollup provides the most efficient and secure scalability solution for the Cosmos Hub and other Cosmos blockchains

**Strengthen Defi Competitiveness For Global Platform Competition**

- Especially, Defi application and pegzones will benefit strongly
    - Applications that users have to put significant asset into layer 2 will benefit from zk-rollup support by the Hub
    - Very short finality latency without no economic assumption : dynamic asset movement across connected blockchains
    - Does not have to possess strong layer 2 security
        - because the computation consistency is verified on layer 1 before confirmation
        - it can reduce the cost of layer 2 operation by minimizing native token economics and its incentives for delegators and validators
- Defi service with Hub-level security
    - Defi service with fast finality on the Hub, perfect Hub-level security, various interchain connectivity will greatly benefit the users so that the Hub can attract more Defi users from outside Cosmos Ecosystem, to possess enough competitiveness to become the mainstream Defi network for heterogenious blockchains
